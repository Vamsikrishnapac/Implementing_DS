// A heap is a special tree - based data structure in which the tree is a complete binary tree. 


// Max - Heap: In a max-heap the key present at the root node must be greatest among the keys present at all of it's children. the same property must be recursively true for all sub-trees in that binary tree 

// Min - Heap: In a Min - heap the key present at the root node must be minimum among the keys present at all of it's children. the same property must be recursively true for all sub - trees in that binary tree
